- Should we have a user login or possibly a type of form validation (https://www.elated.com/form-validation-with-javascript/)?

Portion for comparing or checking a specific vehicle

If they are comparing this should run:
There should be either a form input or dropdown list giving the user the choice to select what kind of vehicle he wants to search 
    - So here we need to have an if statement only sending the search through if both fields are chosen correctly. Try to add automaker logos as buttons.
    **** discuss what would be more effective....dropdown list or a form??
    

Once user approves two choices and hits submit we should populate certain parameters with our AJAX object 

Opinions here as to what should be populated as well as to what should be compared
    - Starting MSRP or current price KBB (Compared?)
    - Fuel Economy (Compared)
    - Curb Weight (Compared)
    - Ownership Cost (Compared)
    - Consumer Rating 
    - Engine Type
    - Transmission
    - Fuel Type
    - Seating Capacity
    - Pros & Cons list
    - Insurance cost.
